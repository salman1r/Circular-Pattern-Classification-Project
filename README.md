# Circular-Pattern-Classification-Project
This classification project classifies the different colors pattern in their particular color region. In this project, I used four layers of neural network with varying size nodes and implemented it with the NumPy library of python. The Relu and sigmoid function is used for the non-linear activation function. After training, we achieve an accuracy of over 70%.
